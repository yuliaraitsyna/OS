# Operating Systems

## Description
Repository for laboratory works of BSU on operating systems.

## [Task 1](https://github.com/yuliaraitsyna/OS/tree/main/Lab1)
This program is designed to process employee records stored in a binary file. It consists of two main components:
1. `creator.exe`: creates a binary file with employee records.
2. `reporter.exe`: reads the binary file, calculates salaries, and outputs the results to a text file.

Additionally covered with Gtests.

## [Task 2](https://github.com/yuliaraitsyna/OS/tree/main/Lab2)
The program allows the user to input an array of integers and then creates two separate threads to perform the following tasks concurrently:

Find the minimum and maximum values in the array.
Calculate the average of the array elements.
After the completion of both threads, the program replaces the occurrences of minimum and maximum values in the array with the calculated average.

## [Task 3](https://github.com/yuliaraitsyna/OS/tree/main/Lab3)
This program is a multi-threaded application written in C++ that demonstrates the use of threads to mark elements in an array. Each thread attempts to mark a random element in the array, and if the chosen element is already marked, it waits for the main thread to signal before retrying.

## [Task 4](https://github.com/yuliaraitsyna/OS/tree/main/Lab4)
A program for message passing between processes via a shared file. The program should consist of one Receiver process and one Sender process. The Sender process sends messages to the Receiver process.

## [Task 5](https://github.com/yuliaraitsyna/OS/tree/main/Lab5)
This project comprises a process server and multiple client processes that interact with the server to perform operations on a binary file containing employee records.
