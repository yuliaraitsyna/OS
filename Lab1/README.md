# Lab1 (Creating processes)

## Description
This program is designed to process employee records stored in a binary file. It consists of two main components:
1. `creator.exe`: creates a binary file with employee records.
2. `reporter.exe`: reads the binary file, calculates salaries, and outputs the results to a text file.

## Usage
- Compile both `creator.cpp` and `reporter.cpp` separately to generate `creator.exe` and `reporter.exe`.
   
   ```bash
   g++ creator.cpp -o creator.exe
   g++ reporter.cpp -o reporter.exe

- Enter binary file name using terminal
- Enter employee's info in console
- Enter output file name using terminal
